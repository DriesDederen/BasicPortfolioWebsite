Now a basic website for codecademy: 
due to time constraints I will do the following in my later portfolio site:
* when hovering a project: it should be clickable with a link to Github
* when hovering a project, the object increases
* Make it responsive

I had to make this project for codecademy, but I already did a lot of CSS & HTML. I want to learn more about JS & React hence I just made this project quick
